Basically updated it but he didn't accept the changes so I cloned it and here it is :)

### I'm not going to respond to issues asking for basic, Google-able troubleshooting questions anymore. If you have one such issue, Google the error.

### This is a BIN sniper bot I made in like 2 hours because all the BIN sniping people seem annoying
Presumably it's pretty badly made since I wasn't getting the "200 mil per hour" figures that the YouTubers kept spouting so feel free to submit pull requests

## How to use:
[Here's a video some dude made that shows the process fairly well](https://youtu.be/ojzcvRCDqJ0)
### Step 1
Download Python 3.7.8. There's literally thousands of guides on how to do this so I'll assume you can figure it out yourself.

### Step 2
Either download this repository or just copy paste all the code from inside `SkyblockSniper.py` into a new file on your computer called `SkyblockSniper.py`, and all the text from `requirements.txt` into a new file on your computer called `requirements.txt`.

### Step 3
Run the command `pip install -r <path to requirements.txt>` in the command prompt (Window key + R, type cmd). For example, on my computer, the path to `requirements.txt` is `C:\Downloads\requirements.txt`, so I'd use `pip install -r C:\Downloads\requirements.txt`.

### Step 4
Run the file `SkyblockSniper.py` by going into command prompt and running the command `python <path to SkyblockSniper.py>`. For example, on my computer, the path to `SkyblockSniper.py` is `C:\Downloads\SkyblockSniper.py`, so I'd use `python C:\Downloads\SkyblockSniper.py`.

### Step 5
Now the script is running good and well. From here, you can just AFK on your island splitscreened watching Netflix or something. As soon as the script finds a good flip, you'll hear a low frequency beep for half a second, and the command to go to the auction is automatically put on your clipboard.

All you have to do is Ctrl+V every time you hear the beep, make sure it's not a scam (sometimes this happens with cosmetics or other market manipulation; can be prevented with NEU's average AH price thing), and then buy it.
